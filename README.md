People in the Black Community are faced with harsher downstream effects (charged at higher rates, assigned more significant charges, convicted at higher rates, given longer sentences, and denied parole more often) than people of other races for similar offenses. This systemic bias in the justice system has a profound and lasting impact on black families, communities and the country. The Open Sentencing solution starter helps expose bias and empowers public defenders to address racial disparities in the judicial system directly. Our solution includes an engaging user interface (UI) that feeds into our pre-trained Bias & Disparity Detection Engine. This innovative engine analyzes fact patterns and rapidly provides statistical analysis that highlights deviations from guidelines by race throughout an accused person's judiciary process. The reports from Open Sentencing solution starter provides clear insights for the public defender to aid in defending against detected bias, ultimately & ideally fairly reducing incarceration for members of the black community.

We created a tool with the goal of reducing sentencing for people impacted by bias and racism.

We found that nearly all sentencing is completed at the plea level for defendants represented by a public defender. We want to provide more information to arm public defenders against powerful and more often strongly equipped prosecutors and judges.
How Tech Can Help

A simple to use tool can make the process of collecting and analyzing data quicker and easier for already very busy and often overloaded public defenders. Our tool can quickly highlight bias and other insights saving valuable time, allowing more focused on reducing sentences. Black Lives Matter - let's legally give people more of life outside of prison.

Our solution works with the bias detection engine and open sentencing - Learn more here: https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/bias-detection-engine and here: https://github.com/Call-for-Code-for-Racial-Justice/Open-Sentencing-Model
Please see the diagram below to understand how data flows through the solution:



Idea/Solution

A Web application where a defense attorney / public defender can upload information about a case and the defendant.

Analyzes available data
Provides public defense attorneys with insights, connections, and bias indicators for each case
Information and outcomes from this tool will be fed into a public site where anyone can see trends and request updates for bias in the criminal justice system
Public defenders can then act immediately on that information to negotiate a better plea or sentence for the defendant.
Key Highlight

Our tool will indicate and denote when bias/racism was detected and highlight it for attorneys to use in defense process. Bias detection (highlighted clearly), demographics from uploads, key sentencing information that we mined and have within our tool, as well as recommendations from our tool make a public defenders job more accessible and frees up time to focus on the case(s).
